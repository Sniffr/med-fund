# Med-Fund Application Testing Report

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Authentication Issues
- **Issue**: Authentication cookie name mismatch between different parts of the application
- **Fix**: Standardized the cookie name to `auth_token` across the entire application
- **Issue**: JWT token structure inconsistency with `userId` vs `id` fields
- **Fix**: Updated token payload structure in login route to use `id` consistently

### 2. Date Formatting Issues
- **Issue**: Date-fns v3.0.0 requires a different import syntax than what's being used in admin components
- **Fix**: Replaced date-fns with native JavaScript date formatting to avoid compatibility issues
- **Affected Files**: `verification-queue.tsx`, `recent-campaigns.tsx`

### 3. API Response Structure Changes
- **Issue**: API responses now include nested `campaigns` and `pagination` keys, but components were trying to access campaigns directly
- **Fix**: Updated components to handle the new response structure
- **Affected Files**: `verification-queue.tsx`, `recent-campaigns.tsx`, `campaigns/page.tsx`

### 4. MongoDB Connection Configuration
- **Issue**: MongoDB connection was using hardcoded credentials
- **Fix**: Updated MongoDB connection to use environment variables properly
- **Affected Files**: `lib/db/mongodb.js`

### 5. Email Sending Functionality
- **Issue**: Email sending operations were blocking API routes when they failed
- **Fix**: Added proper error handling to prevent blocking the application
- **Affected Files**: `verify/route.js`, `reject/route.js`, `suspend/route.js`

### 6. Environment Variable Configuration
- **Issue**: Environment variables were not properly defined or loaded
- **Fix**: Created `.env.example` file and updated Next.js configuration
- **Affected Files**: `next.config.js`, `.env.example`
